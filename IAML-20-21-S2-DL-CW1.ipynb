    "\n",
    "### Author: Nigel Goddard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It is important that you follow the instructions below carefully for things to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to set up and activate your environment as you would do for your labs, see Learn section on Labs.  **You will need to use Noteable to create one of the files you will submit (the PDF)**.  Do **NOT** create the PDF in some other way, we will not be able to mark it.  If you want to develop your answers in your own environment, you should make sure you are using the same packages we are using, by running the cell which does imports below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the instructions in this notebook carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the required code/markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .csv files that you will be using are located in the ./datasets directory that is included in the git repository with this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered in 2-3 lines, a few will take longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to distinguish between attributes (columns of the data) and features (which typically refers only to the independent variables, i.e. excluding the target variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to show all your code/working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow PEP8 to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. Do use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will see <html>\\\\pagebreak</html> at the start of each subquestion.  ***Do not remove these, if you do we will not be able to mark your coursework.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "This assignment will account for 20% of your final mark. We ask you to submit answers to all questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit a PDF of your Notebook, and the Notebook itself.  Your grade will be based on the PDF, we will only use the Notebook if we need to see details.  **You must use the following procedure to create the materials to submit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your Notebook and the datasets are in Noteable and will run.  If you developed your answers in Noteable, this is already done.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select **Kernel->Restart & Run All** to create a clean copy of your submission, this will run the cells in order from top to bottom.  This may take a while (minutes) to complete, ensure that all the output and plots have complete before you proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select **File->Download as->PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)** and wait for the PDF to be created and downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select **File->Download as->Notebook (.ipynb)**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You now should have in your download folder the pdf and the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission of these two files will be made on Learn, details will be announced and documented on Learn well before the deadline**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The submission deadline for this assignment is **9th February 2021 at 16:00 UK time (UTC)**.  Don't leave it to the last minute!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMPORTS\n",
    "Execute the cell below to import all packages you will be using for this assignment.  If you are not using Noteable, make sure the python and package version numbers reported match the python and package numbers specified in the comment at the end of this cell."
